//
// HTML form and file uploader via HTTP POST.
//
// When tickled, each index file in "queueDirPath" with extension "formExtension" will be opened
// and read for form data to be uploaded to URL "formPostURL" via HTTP POST.
// The format of the index file is 1 form field per line. From the beginning of the line up to
// the first ',' character is taken as the field name. The rest of the line after the ','
// up to the end-of-line is taken as the field contents.
// A field with the name 'file' is treated differently. If such a field is found, the field
// contents are taken as the pathname to a file to be uploaded. The file will be uploaded
// under a field named 'file', with its filename (not including any other path component)
// supplied as the filename portion of the field.
//
// Uses libcURL internally.
// Don't forget to add library load calls on the Java side:
//    static {
//    	System.loadLibrary("crypto");
//    	System.loadLibrary("ssl");
//    	System.loadLibrary("curl");
//    }
